# RAG Patterns: GraphRAG VBD - Lab Instructions

## GraphRAG

Please reference the [GraphRAG Getting Started instructions here](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/get_started/). The VBD closely follows these instructions and the library changes frequently. 
These instructions will always be in sync with the library.

## GraphRAG Accelerator

The GraphRAG Accelerator is, as of FY26, a [public archived repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator).

It is the reference implementation for GraphRAG deployments at scale using APIM and AKS, but it is no longer receiving updates or support.

CSAs delivering this VBD should determine with their customers whether the Accelerator is appropriate to cover and how it needs to be tailored to the outcomes and goals of the customer.
The final module of the VBD covering the Accelerator is intended to be entirely driven by the CSA in accordance with their customer's goals, to include not covering it at all.
