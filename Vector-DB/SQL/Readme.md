## Introduction
This lab shows you how to use Azure SQL Database as a backend for storing and searching vector data in AI scenarios.
 
## Objectives
Store and retrieve vector data.
Perform similarity searches using PostgreSQL.
 
## Estimated Time
20 minutes
 
## Scenario
You need a relational database solution (SQL DB) that also supports storing and querying AI vector data. This lab guides you through the process, step by step.
 
## Pre-requisites
None. The database has been pre-created for you.
 
## Tasks
Execute files in [SQL folder](https://github.com/Azure/WPLUS-Azure-AI-Platform-and-Services/tree/AugRelease/Vector-DB/Cosmos%20DB) in ascending order. Files are numberd 1_.... , 2_.... etc. The .sql files need to be executed in SQL Server Management Studio, which is preloaded on Desktop for you, while .py files are executed with "python file.py" - for example "python 2_LoadMovideData.py" (the previous assumes you have nagivated to the directory containing the Python file).
